In this project, we designed and implemented a scalable, relational database system tailored for a modern car rental service. Built with a focus on real-world operational needs, the system enables seamless management of end-to-end rental workflowsâ€”including customer registration, vehicle availability, booking lifecycle, payment tracking, insurance management, and promotional campaigns.

With support for complex queries, status tracking, and comprehensive CRUD operations, the database is optimized to serve both front-line staff and backend administrators. Whether it's analyzing fleet availability across multiple locations, reviewing customer histories, or generating reports on rental trends, this system delivers the data backbone needed to run an efficient, customer-centric rental business. The architecture is modular, extensible, and built to support data-driven decision-making in a competitive mobility market.
